# BookReader Protocols Module

The Protocols module of the BookReader program defines the different protocols used throughout the application to provide a seamless reading experience to users.

## Architecture

The Protocols module is designed using the Swift Package Manager. It contains different protocols that define the behavior of different components in the application. The BookMetadatable protocol is used to define the metadata of different types of books. The Bookshelfable protocol is used to define the behavior of bookshelves, which hold multiple books. The BookOpenable protocol is used to define the behavior of opening and reading books. The BookCover protocol is used to define the cover of different types of books. The HashableSynthesizable protocol is used to define the behavior of hashable and synthesizable components.

## Summary

The Protocols module of the BookReader program defines the different protocols used throughout the application to provide a seamless reading experience to users. The BookMetadatable protocol is used to define the metadata of different types of books. The Bookshelfable protocol is used to define the behavior of bookshelves, which hold multiple books. The BookOpenable protocol is used to define the behavior of opening and reading books. The BookCover protocol is used to define the cover of different types of books. The HashableSynthesizable protocol is used to define the behavior of hashable and synthesizable components. The module is designed using the Swift Package Manager.


## List of protocols

The Protocols module contains the following protocols:

- `HashableSynthesizable`: A protocol for types that can be synthesized from a hash value. It requires the conforming type to define a static method `synthesize` that takes a hash value as input and returns an instance of the type.

- `BookMetadatable`: A protocol for types that represent book metadata. It requires the conforming type to define properties for book title, author, and publication date.

- `Bookshelfable`: A protocol for types that represent bookshelves. It requires the conforming type to define properties for bookshelf name and a collection of books.

- `BookOpenable`: A protocol for types that can open and display books. It requires the conforming type to define a method `open` that takes a book object as input and displays it in the appropriate view.

- `BookCover`: A protocol for types that represent book covers. It requires the conforming type to define a property for the cover image.

- `Bookshelf`: A protocol for types that represent bookshelves. It requires the conforming type to define properties for bookshelf name and a collection of books.


## Implementation details

Each protocol is defined in a separate Swift file with the protocol name as the file name. The implementation of each protocol is left to the conforming types.

The Protocols module does not have any dependencies on other modules in the BookReader program.
