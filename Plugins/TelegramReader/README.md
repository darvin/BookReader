# TelegramReader Plugin for BookReader

TelegramReader is a plugin for BookReader that allows you to access and read books that are shared on Telegram groups and private conversations. This plugin is especially useful for those who want to access and read books that are not available in traditional libraries or bookstores.

## The Power of Sharing

Sharing is a powerful human instinct that allows us to connect with each other and enrich our lives. Sharing books is a great way to spread knowledge and ideas, and to learn from each other's experiences and perspectives. However, many books are not easily accessible or are not available in traditional libraries or bookstores.

Telegram is a popular messaging app that allows users to share books and other files with each other. By using the TelegramReader plugin, you can access and read these books in a convenient and organized way.

## Features

TelegramReader provides the following features:

- Access to user-shared books on Telegram groups and private conversations
- Search for books by title, author, or keyword
- Download books for offline reading
- Organize books into collections

Once you have downloaded a book, you can start reading it in BookReader's PDF reader. The seamless zoom preserving scrolling feature allows you to zoom in or out of the book without losing your place in the text.
